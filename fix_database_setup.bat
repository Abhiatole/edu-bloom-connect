echo Teacher Dashboard Enhancement - Database Setup
echo =============================================
echo.

echo ERROR RESOLUTION: "syntax error at or near NOT"
echo.
echo The issue was with the CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS syntax.
echo PostgreSQL/Supabase doesn't support IF NOT EXISTS with CREATE POLICY.
echo.

echo SOLUTION:
echo 1. Use the SAFE version of the SQL script
echo 2. Run it step by step in Supabase SQL Editor
echo.

echo Choose your setup method:
echo [1] Open SAFE SQL file (recommended)
echo [2] Open original SQL file (fixed)
echo [3] View setup instructions
echo.

set /p choice="Enter your choice (1-3): "

if "%choice%"=="1" (
    echo Opening TEACHER_SUBJECT_SETUP_SAFE.sql...
    start notepad TEACHER_SUBJECT_SETUP_SAFE.sql
    echo.
    echo INSTRUCTIONS:
    echo 1. Copy sections step by step from the opened file
    echo 2. Run each step separately in Supabase SQL Editor
    echo 3. Wait for each step to complete before running the next
)

if "%choice%"=="2" (
    echo Opening TEACHER_SUBJECT_SETUP.sql (fixed version)...
    start notepad TEACHER_SUBJECT_SETUP.sql
    echo.
    echo This version has been fixed - no more IF NOT EXISTS with policies
)

if "%choice%"=="3" (
    echo.
    echo SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
    echo ==================
    echo.
    echo 1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
    echo 2. Navigate to SQL Editor
    echo 3. Copy and paste the SQL content
    echo 4. Click "Run" to execute the script
    echo.
    echo The script will:
    echo - Create subjects, student_subjects, teacher_subjects tables
    echo - Set up Row Level Security policies
    echo - Create helper functions
    echo - Add sample subjects
    echo - Create database indexes for performance
    echo.
    echo After running the script successfully:
    echo - Restart your development server
    echo - Test the enhanced Teacher Dashboard
    echo - Register students with subject selection
    echo - Assign subjects to teachers via admin interface
)

echo.
echo After running the database setup:
echo 1. The Teacher Dashboard will show subject-specific data
echo 2. Student registration will include subject selection
echo 3. Teachers will only see students in their assigned subjects
echo 4. All features will be subject-scoped and secure
echo.
