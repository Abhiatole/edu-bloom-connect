# 🚀 Student Registration Workflow - Database Fix Required

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Apply Database Migration First

**Before testing the student registration workflow, you MUST apply the database migration:**

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. **Copy the entire content** of `fix_student_registration_flow.sql`
3. **Paste and Run** the script
4. ✅ **Expected Success Message**: "🎉 Student Registration Flow Database Setup Complete!"

### What This Migration Does:
- ✅ **Adds missing columns** to `student_profiles` table:
  - `student_mobile` (VARCHAR(15))
  - `enrollment_no` (VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE)
  - `parent_email` (VARCHAR(255))

- ✅ **Creates new tables**:
  - `batches` (NEET/JEE/CET/Other)
  - `student_batches` (student-batch relationships)
  - `subjects` (Physics/Chemistry/Biology/Mathematics)
  - `student_subjects` (student-subject relationships)

- ✅ **Sets up automatic enrollment number generation**:
  - Format: STU000001, STU000002, etc.
  - Triggers automatically on student creation

- ✅ **Creates helper functions**:
  - `enroll_student_in_batches()`
  - `enroll_student_in_subjects()`
  - `generate_enrollment_number()`

- ✅ **Sets up proper RLS policies** for security

### Step 2: Test Registration Flow
After applying the migration, test the complete flow:

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:8083/register/student
2. **Fill form** with test data
3. **Select subjects** (at least one required)
4. **Select batches** (at least one required)
5. **Submit registration**
6. **Verify**: Success message and enrollment number generated

### Step 3: Test Approval Workflow
1. **Admin Dashboard**: http://localhost:8083/admin/approvals
2. **Find pending student** in approval list
3. **Click "Approve"** → Confirm
4. **Verify**: Student moves to approved list

### Step 4: Test Student Dashboard
1. **Login as approved student**
2. **Go to**: http://localhost:8083/student/dashboard
3. **Verify displays**:
   - ✅ Enrollment number prominently shown
   - ✅ Enrolled subjects as badges
   - ✅ Enrolled batches as badges
   - ✅ Performance metrics (when available)

## 🎯 Expected Results After Migration

### Registration Form:
- ✅ All fields capture correctly
- ✅ Subject selection works (multi-select)
- ✅ Batch selection works (multi-select)
- ✅ Validation prevents empty selections
- ✅ Success message shows enrollment number

### Admin/Teacher Approval:
- ✅ Pending students visible in dashboard
- ✅ Approve/reject buttons functional
- ✅ Real-time status updates
- ✅ Subject-specific filtering for teachers

### Student Dashboard:
- ✅ Enrollment number displayed
- ✅ Enrolled subjects shown as badges
- ✅ Enrolled batches shown as badges
- ✅ Performance analytics (when exams taken)

- ✅ Approval notification sent (with enrollment number)
- ✅ Login credentials info (NO password included)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### If Registration Fails:
```
Error: "foreign key constraint"
→ Solution: Database migration not applied correctly
→ Re-run the migration script
```

### If Subjects/Batches Don't Show:
```
Error: "No data available"
→ Solution: Check if tables were created
→ Verify RLS policies allow reading
```

### If Enrollment Number Missing:
```
Error: "No enrollment number"
→ Solution: Check trigger function was created
→ Verify AUTO-GENERATION trigger is active
```
