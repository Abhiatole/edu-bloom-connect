# 🔧 REGISTRATION FIX - SQL MIGRATION REQUIRED

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Manual SQL Migration Required

The registration system has been fixed, but you need to run the SQL migration manually in Supabase.

### 📋 Steps to Fix Registration:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

2. **Run the Migration**
   - Open the file: `fix_registration_system.sql` (in your project root)
   - Copy the entire content of this file
   - Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute the migration

3. **Verify the Fix**
   - After running the migration, test registration at:
     - Student: `http://localhost:5173/register/student`
     - Teacher: `http://localhost:5173/register/teacher`
     - Admin: `http://localhost:5173/register/admin`

### ✅ What the Migration Does:

- **Fixes Database Schema**: Adds missing columns to profile tables
- **Creates Secure Functions**: Bypass functions for profile creation
- **Sets Up Triggers**: Automatic profile creation on user signup/confirmation
- **Enables RLS**: Secure but permissive policies for registration
- **Adds Constraints**: Proper foreign keys and indexes

### 🚀 Code Changes Completed:

- ✅ Updated all registration services to use `FinalRegistrationService`
- ✅ Removed all `console.log()` and debug statements
- ✅ Fixed email confirmation handling
- ✅ Updated registration pages to use clean service
- ✅ Consolidated registration logic

### 🧪 Testing After Migration:

1. Try registering a new student with test email
2. Check email confirmation flow
3. Verify profile creation in database
4. Test different roles (student, teacher, admin)

### 🔍 If Issues Persist:

1. Check Supabase logs for database errors
2. Verify RLS policies are enabled
3. Ensure auth.users trigger is working
4. Check foreign key constraints
