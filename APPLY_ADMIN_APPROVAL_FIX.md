# üöÄ APPLY THE ADMIN APPROVAL FIX

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### STEP 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **edu-bloom-connect**
3. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"New Query"**

### STEP 2: Run the RLS Policy Fix

Copy and paste this **EXACT SQL** into the SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Allow admins to update student profiles
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update student profiles" ON student_profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update student profiles" ON student_profiles
    FOR UPDATE USING (
        user_id = auth.uid() OR
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role = 'ADMIN'
            AND approval_status = 'APPROVED'
        )
    );

-- Allow admins to update teacher profiles  
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update teacher profiles" ON teacher_profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update teacher profiles" ON teacher_profiles
    FOR UPDATE USING (
        user_id = auth.uid() OR
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role = 'ADMIN'
            AND approval_status = 'APPROVED'
        )
    );

SELECT 'Admin approval RLS policies updated successfully!' as result;
```

3. Click **"Run"** button
4. You should see: **"Admin approval RLS policies updated successfully!"**

### STEP 3: Test the Fix

**Option A: Test via Command Line**
```bash
node test-approval-fix.js
```
- Look for: **"Update successful! Affected 1 rows"**
- Look for: **"SUCCESS: Student was successfully approved!"**

**Option B: Test via Admin Dashboard**
1. Go to: http://localhost:8081/admin/approvals
2. Find a user in the **"Pending"** tab
3. Click **"Approve"** button
4. Expected result: User moves to **"Approved"** tab immediately

### STEP 4: Verify Success

**‚úÖ Signs the fix worked:**
- No console errors when clicking approve
- Users move between tabs instantly
- Success toast notifications appear
- Statistics update in real-time

**‚ùå Signs the fix didn't work:**
- Error: "No rows were updated"
- Error: "Permission denied"
- Users stay in pending tab after clicking approve

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If the fix doesn't work:

1. **Check admin user status:**
   ```sql
   SELECT email, role, approval_status 
   FROM user_profiles up
   JOIN auth.users au ON up.user_id = au.id
   WHERE au.email = 'getgifts257@gmail.com';
   ```
   - Should show: role = 'ADMIN', approval_status = 'APPROVED'

2. **Check if policies were created:**
   ```sql
   SELECT policyname, tablename 
   FROM pg_policies 
   WHERE tablename IN ('student_profiles', 'teacher_profiles')
   AND policyname LIKE '%Admins can update%';
   ```
   - Should show 2 policies

3. **Hard refresh the browser:** Ctrl+F5

## üéØ What This Fix Does

**Before Fix:**
- RLS Policy: "Only allow `user_id = auth.uid()`"
- Admin tries to update student profile
- Database: "Admin ID ‚â† Student ID, BLOCKED!"
- Result: ‚ùå 0 rows updated

**After Fix:**
- RLS Policy: "Allow if `user_id = auth.uid()` OR user is approved admin"
- Admin tries to update student profile  
- Database: "User is approved admin, ALLOWED!"
- Result: ‚úÖ 1 row updated

The fix adds the missing permission for admins to update other users' profiles while maintaining security for regular users.
