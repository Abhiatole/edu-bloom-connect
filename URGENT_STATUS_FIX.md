# IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - STATUS UPDATE FIX

## The Issue
The status is not being updated in the database because the database schema doesn't have the `status` column yet.

## Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### 1. Execute Database Migration
1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire content from `APPLY_STATUS_COLUMNS_FIX.sql`
4. Paste and **Execute** the script

### 2. Verify It Worked
After running the SQL script, run this verification query:
```sql
SELECT 'Status Check' as info, status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM student_profiles 
GROUP BY status
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Status Check' as info, status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM teacher_profiles 
GROUP BY status;
```

You should see results like:
```
Status Check | PENDING | 5
Status Check | APPROVED | 2
```

### 3. Test the Application
After the database migration:
- Register a new user → Status should be 'PENDING'
- Approve a user → Status should change to 'APPROVED'
- Check the admin dashboard → Should show users by status

## What's Already Fixed in the Code

✅ **Registration Service** - Sets `status: 'PENDING'` for new users
✅ **Approval Service** - Updates status on approve/reject
✅ **TypeScript Types** - Include status fields
✅ **UI Components** - Display and filter by status
✅ **Database Triggers** - Automatically maintain status consistency

## Files That Are Ready

- `src/services/registrationService.ts` ✅
- `src/services/approvalService.ts` ✅  
- `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` ✅
- `src/components/RegistrationStatusTracker.tsx` ✅
- `src/components/WorkflowManagementDashboard.tsx` ✅

## The Only Missing Piece

The database schema needs the status columns. Once you run the SQL migration script, everything will work perfectly.

**Run the SQL script now and the status updates will start working immediately!**
