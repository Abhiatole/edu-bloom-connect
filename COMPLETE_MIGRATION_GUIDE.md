- `exam_time` - Time when exam is scheduled  
- `duration_minutes` - Exam duration
- `description` - Detailed exam description
- `question_paper_url` - File upload URL
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

#### 2. `exam_results` Table

## 🛡️ Safety Features

The migration is **completely safe** because it:
- ✅ Checks what exists before making changes
- ✅ Only adds missing tables/columns
- ✅ Preserves all existing data
- ✅ Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` for all operations
- ✅ Can be run multiple times safely
- ✅ Provides detailed logging

## 📊 Expected Output

When you run the migration, you'll see messages like:
```
✅ Created exams table
✅ Added status column to exams table
✅ Added max_marks column to exams table
✅ Created exam_results table
✅ Created parent_notifications table
🎉 MIGRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
```

## 🧪 Testing After Migration

### 1. Run Verification Script
Execute `verify_migration.sql` to ensure everything is set up correctly.

### 2. Test the Dashboard
1. Visit: `http://localhost:8080/teacher/dashboard`
2. Try creating an exam
3. Test result entry (manual and Excel)
4. Test parent notifications

### 3. Expected Behavior
- ✅ No "column does not exist" errors
- ✅ All dashboard features work
- ✅ Data saves and loads correctly
- ✅ File uploads work
- ✅ Notifications can be generated

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Migration Fails
1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure you have database admin rights
2. **Review Error Messages**: Look for specific error details
3. **Check Existing Data**: Some operations might conflict with existing data
4. **Contact Support**: Provide error logs for assistance

### If Dashboard Still Shows Errors
1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Refresh the application
2. **Check Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
3. **Verify Migration**: Run `verify_migration.sql` again
4. **Restart Dev Server**: `npm run dev`

## 📞 Support

If you need help:
1. Check the migration output logs
2. Run the verification script
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure all required columns exist

## ✅ Success Criteria

Migration is successful when:
- ✅ All tables exist with correct columns
